### Overview

FS2 is a library for purely functional, effectful, and polymorphic stream processing library in the [Scala programming language](https://scala-lang.org). Its design goals are compositionality, expressiveness, resource safety, and speed. The name is a modified acronym for **F**unctional **S**treams for **Scala** (FSS, or FS2).

FS2 is available for Scala 2.11, Scala 2.12, and [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/). FS2 is built upon two major functional libraries for Scala, [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/), and [Cats-Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/). Regardless of those dependencies, FS2 core types (streams and pulls) are polymorphic in the effect type (as long as it is compatible with `cats-effect` typeclasses), and thus FS2 can be used with other IO libraries, such as [Monix](https://monix.io/), or [ZIO](https://scalaz.github.io/scalaz-zio/).

Prior to the 0.9 release in 2016, FS2 was known as `scalaz-stream`, which was based on the [`scalaz`](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) library.

### <a id="getit"></a> Where to get the latest version ###

The latest version is 1.0.x. See the badge at the top of the README for the exact version number.

The [1.0 migration guide](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2/blob/series/1.0/docs/migration-guide-1.0.md)
summarizes the differences between 1.0 and 0.10. To get 1.0.x, add the following to your SBT build:

```
// available for Scala 2.11, 2.12
libraryDependencies += "co.fs2" %% "fs2-core" % "1.0.2" // For cats 1.5.0 and cats-effect 1.1.0

// optional I/O library
libraryDependencies += "co.fs2" %% "fs2-io" % "1.0.2"

// optional reactive streams interop
libraryDependencies += "co.fs2" %% "fs2-reactive-streams" % "1.0.2"

// optional experimental library
libraryDependencies += "co.fs2" %% "fs2-experimental" % "1.0.2"
```

The previous stable release is 0.10.6. You may want to first
[read the 0.10 migration guide](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2/blob/series/0.10/docs/migration-guide-0.10.md)
if you are upgrading from 0.9 or earlier. To get 0.10, add the following to your SBT build:

```
// available for Scala 2.11, 2.12
libraryDependencies += "co.fs2" %% "fs2-core" % "0.10.6"

// optional I/O library
libraryDependencies += "co.fs2" %% "fs2-io" % "0.10.6"
```

The fs2-core library is also supported on Scala.js:

```
libraryDependencies += "co.fs2" %%% "fs2-core" % "0.10.6"
```

### <a id="about"></a>Example ###

FS2 is a streaming I/O library. The design goals are compositionality, expressiveness, resource safety, and speed. Here's a simple example of its use:

```scala
import cats.effect.{ExitCode, IO, IOApp, Resource}
import cats.implicits._
import fs2.{io, text, Stream}
import java.nio.file.Paths
import java.util.concurrent.Executors
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext

object Converter extends IOApp {
  private val blockingExecutionContext =
    Resource.make(IO(ExecutionContext.fromExecutorService(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2))))(ec => IO(ec.shutdown()))

  val converter: Stream[IO, Unit] = Stream.resource(blockingExecutionContext).flatMap { blockingEC =>
    def fahrenheitToCelsius(f: Double): Double =
      (f - 32.0) * (5.0/9.0)

    io.file.readAll[IO](Paths.get("testdata/fahrenheit.txt"), blockingEC, 4096)
      .through(text.utf8Decode)
      .through(text.lines)
      .filter(s => !s.trim.isEmpty && !s.startsWith("//"))
      .map(line => fahrenheitToCelsius(line.toDouble).toString)
      .intersperse("\n")
      .through(text.utf8Encode)
      .through(io.file.writeAll(Paths.get("testdata/celsius.txt"), blockingEC))
  }
  
  def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] =
    converter.compile.drain.as(ExitCode.Success)
}
```

This will construct a program that reads lines incrementally from `testdata/fahrenheit.txt`, skipping blank lines and commented lines. It then parses temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit, converts these to Celsius, UTF-8 encodes the output, and writes incrementally to `testdata/celsius.txt`, using constant memory. The input and output files will be closed upon normal termination or if exceptions occur.

Note that this example is specialised to `IO` for simplicity, but `Stream` is fully polymorphic in the effect type (the `F[_]` in `Stream[F, A]`), as long as `F[_]` is compatible with the `cats-effect` typeclasses.

The library supports a number of other interesting use cases:

* _Zipping and merging of streams:_ A streaming computation may read from multiple sources in a streaming fashion, zipping or merging their elements using an arbitrary function. In general, clients have a great deal of flexibility in what sort of topologies they can define, due to `Stream` being a first class entity with a very rich algebra of combinators.
* _Dynamic resource allocation:_ A streaming computation may allocate resources dynamically (for instance, reading a list of files to process from a stream built off a network socket), and the library will ensure these resources get released upon normal termination or if exceptions occur.
* _Nondeterministic and concurrent processing:_ A computation may read from multiple input streams simultaneously, using whichever result comes back first, and a pipeline of transformations can allow for nondeterminism and queueing at each stage. Due to several concurrency combinators and data structures, streams can be used as light-weight, declarative threads to build complex concurrent behaviour compositionally.

These features mean that FS2 goes beyond streaming I/O to offer a very general and declarative model for arbitrary control flow.

### <a id="docs"></a>Documentation and getting help ###

* There are Scaladoc API documentations for [the core library][core-api], which defines and implements the core types for streams and pulls, as well as the type aliases for pipes and sinks. [The `io` library][io-api] provides FS2 bindings for NIO-based file I/O and TCP/UDP networking
* [The official guide](https://functional-streams-for-scala.github.io/fs2/guide.html) is a good starting point for learning more about the library.
* The [documentation page](https://functional-streams-for-scala.github.io/fs2/faq.html) is intended to serve as a list of all references, including conference presentation recordings, academic papers, and blog posts, on the use and implementation of `fs2`. 
* [The FAQ](https://functional-streams-for-scala.github.io/fs2/faq.html) has frequently asked questions. Feel free to open issues or PRs with additions to the FAQ!
* Also feel free to come discuss and ask/answer questions in [the gitter channel](https://gitter.im/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2) and/or on StackOverflow using [the tag FS2](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/fs2). Gitter will generally get you a quicker answer.
